silly game for an assignment
## How to play
The bricks from falling from somewhere and are targetting innocent little cats. With your trusty (suspiciously cat looking) slingshot, and high amounts of tennis rackets, you need to redirect the bricks away from the cats.
Hitting bricks gives you points, you can get combos by hitting multiple bricks with one racket.
### Controls
The game only uses the mouse, all you need to do is hold left click and the racket will follow the direction you move your mouse into. Once you release left click the racket fly off the slingshot.

## AI Experience Reflection
### Pros
i guess I always forget the first parts of making a pygame project, like including the pygame init, making the screen object, and setting the caption; So A.I. gave me that, but I think its way easier for me to just look in an older project or somewhere on the internet to get that instead.
I didn't know about the enumerate function until I saw the code that A.I. generated showing it, and its been super useful, so its cool to know it now.
A.I. gave me an ok place to start, thats really about it.
### Cons
Sometimes A.I. gives me bad code that doesn't run and I have to fix it or be super specific on what it missed and how it can fix it.
I also kind of enjoy making some of the code, I don't need an A.I. to make it for me.
